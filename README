SLeek
By: Delta Czukor

Since the interface seems pretty straightforward, I'm simply going to list what does and doesn't work in SLeek.

What works:
- Logging in!
- Receiving and sending chat (whisper, say, shout) from agents and objects.
- Receiving a list of nearby agents and objects.
- Teleporting.
- Sending and receiving IMs.
- People search.
- SLeek Scripting (runtime code compilation, can hook into SLeek/SLNetCom/libsecondlife).
- Inventory support (not all item types supported yet).
- Sending typing animation when typing.
- Setting away/busy status.
- Flying.
- Autopilot (+ flying).
- Profile viewing (basic).
- Receiving teleport offers.
- Debug log.
- Region search.
- Basic Friends functionality.
- Offering teleports to friends.

What doesn't work (or just isn't there yet):
- Groups functionality.
- Offline IMs
- Too much other stuff. :P

Shortcuts:
- Enter/Return: Says the inputted chat text.
- Ctrl+Enter: Shouts the inputted chat text.
- Ctrl+Shift+Enter: Whispers the inputted chat text.
- Ctrl+Alt+D: Toggles the Debug menu (next to Help, may take two or three tries).
